# Classifiers
Meet the classifiers: Naive Bayes and Two versions of Logistic Regression

In this project, the data set is downloaded from https://goo.gl/gYacor, which consist of the face and non-face image files. Implemented the Naive Bayes Classifier and reported the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-1 measure. ROC graph is drawn. With the same dataset, logistic regression with Batch gradient and Stochastic gradient algorithm is implemented.
